COMMENTS
Due to the way text is displayed in Windows and colors are set you can only change the color for an
entire row. However, if you have a window active the row would be within that window and wouldn't
affect other lines outside that window. For more information on colors and windows please refer to
Chapter 11 - Windows Programming.
