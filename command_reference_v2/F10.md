COMMENTS
Traps are event driven rather than process commands. Nothing actually happens when the command is
executed until the appropriate key is pressed or the action occurs.
The ESC and INT trap work in the following manner:
ESC - If set this trap will be executed at any ENTER command. If it is not set, or set to DFLT,
if the user presses the ESC key at an ENTER command the program will terminate,
returning to a previous program, or DOS if there was no previous program.. If set to
IGNR the bell will sound and the user will remain in the ENTER.
INT - This trap is checked between each command and is generally used during reports or other
processing where you want to allow the user to exit (or not) and there won’t be an ENTER
command. The only way TAS Pro 5.1 will allow your user to exit during non-ENTER
operations is if this trap is set to some value. Both DFLT and IGNR will not allow an exit
if the ESC key is pressed.
The RLCK trap works in the following manner:
