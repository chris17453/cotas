# HOT SPOT

## Summary
HOT SPOT (Windows only)
Use this command to mark a spot on the screen where the user can click with their mouse. Since the Hot
Spot itself is clear you would generally put this over another picture, or an area on the screen. Each time
the user clicks the Hot Spot it will be just as though they had pressed the key that you setup as the KEY
value.
