# AUTO ENTER LIST

## Summary
This is used in connection with the LISTM (List Array) and LISTF (List File) commands either prior to
the command being executed the first time or upon return from an ENTER UDF. This command will
cause the program to automatically execute the ENTER UDF again without waiting for the user to press
the ENTER key. Generally this command is used in conjunction with the AUTOINC or AUTODEC
command.
