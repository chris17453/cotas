# LIST EXIT

## Summary
This is used in connection with the LISTM (List Array) and LISTF (List File) commands. If you are
executing one of those commands and are in a routine ‘outside’ of the command (e.g., an enter process),
you can use this command to terminate the LISTF or LISTM command when you return to it.
