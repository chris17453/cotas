# GRAY ON/OFF

## Summary
ON/OFF - Required - If you set this option to ON any windows that become inactive after the
command will be "grayed out." This means the type will be displayed in 'gray' format.
What this is depends on the version of Windows you are running and what colors you
have set for your screen. If you set this option to OFF then the gray process does not
occur.
COMMENTS
It does take some extra time to gray out inactive windows and if you set this to ON it will slow your
programs down to some extent. Again, this is very dependent on your computer, amount of memory,
etc. You can also set this value in TP5WIN.INI. For more information on this please refer to Chapter
11 - Windows Programming.
