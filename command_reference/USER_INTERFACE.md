# USER INTERFACE

## Summary
The equivalent action (CLR ... BUFF) occurs if the user presses the F3 key and no TRAP's are set for
that key. The program will clear all open files. If none are opened, nothing will happen. If a screen is
mounted and there are fields from any of these files on that screen, the values will be cleared.
