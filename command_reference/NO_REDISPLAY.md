# NO REDISPLAY

## Summary
Normally in the LISTM (List Array) or LISTF (List File) commands, when the program returns to the
command from a UDF call, the screen displayed previous to the UDF call is redisplayed. In the case
where you now have something new on the screen and don’t wish for it to reappear this should be
specified.
