COMMENTS
Normally in the ENTER command if the vld option is set and the expression returns .F., a vldm (valid
message) is displayed, or if you have not provided one, a generalized message is displayed. In certain
instances you might have multiple valid messages depending on other circumstances. In that situation
you can display the appropriate message in the vld check itself and by using this command, a generalized message will not be displayed when the program returns to the ENTER command.
