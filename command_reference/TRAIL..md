# TRAIL.

## Summary
character_to_use - f/c/e - Optional - The fill character. This really isn’t optional, however, if
this value is not set by you the default is binary 0. You may use any type of field or
expression, but the program will only use the first character (byte) of the resultant
field.
times - f/c/e - Optional - If the field being filled is an array you may stipulate how many
elements to fill using this option. You may also specify the beginning array element
number, if other than 1, in the fieldname in the normal fashion.
