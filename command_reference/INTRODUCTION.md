# INTRODUCTION

## Summary
There are five different structures that can be used within a program. Each one is a little different and
would be used in specific situations. Often the decision to use a specific structure is strictly due to your
likes or dislikes.
These structures are very solid. By this we mean that you could do a GOTO from one section of a
structure into a totally different section or even GOTO a different structure, and the program would
know just what to do. Of course, we're not suggesting you do this! We only want you to know that if
you set the structure up properly, it should always work as expected.
In the examples given below, the beginning and ending lines of the structure are given, and the possible
loop options are shown within the structure. There is no requirement to use any of the ‘intrastructure’
options; however, the beginning and ending commands are required to form the structure properly.
Each structure type can be nested up to 20 deep. For example:
IF x = y
IF z = 1
IF q = 1 .A. test = ‘abc’
... etc. till there are 20 IF/ENDIF pairs
