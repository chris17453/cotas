## Description

Use this command to automatically gray out inactive windows.

## Syntax

```text
GRAY ON/OFF
```

## Parameters

- **`ON/OFF`** · `flag` · *Required*

  ON/OFF - Required - If you set this option to ON any windows that become inactive after the command will be "grayed out." This means the type will be displayed in 'gray' format. What this is depends on the version of Windows you are running and what colors you have set for your screen. If you set this option to OFF then the gray process does not occur.

## Comments

It does take some extra time to gray out inactive windows and if you set this to ON it will slow your programs down to some extent. Again, this is very dependent on your computer, amount of memory, etc. You can also set this value in TP5WIN.INI. For more information on this please refer to Chapter 11 - Windows Programming.
