## Description

When you want to use a UDC defined elsewhere in your program (using the CMD command) or in a separate library all you need to do is put the command name on the line followed by the values to be passed to the routine.

## Syntax

```text
cmd_name cmd_options
```

## Parameters

- **`cmd_name`** · `sac` · *Required*

  The name of the UDC.

- **`cmd_options`** · `f/c/e1,f/c/e2...f/c/ex` · *Optional*

  The values to be passed to the UDC. There should be at least one space between the cmd_name and the cmd_options. Separate the options with commas. Do not surround them with parentheses as you would a UDF or function.

## Comments

This is how you will actually execute the UDC. You set up the UDC using the CMD command. See the details under COMMAND.
