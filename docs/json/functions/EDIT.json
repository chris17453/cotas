Before you call this function be sure to create a window where the editing will take place. If you haven't created a window the function will use the entire base window. At the bottom of the window the function creates two buttons, one is F10 To Save Memo, and the other is ESC Exit without Saving. If the user clicks on the F10 button or presses the F10 key the function will put the new note/memo in the field provided and returns .T. If the user presses the ESC key (or button) the function will not change the field provided and returns .F.",
