If you use this option, be\nsure to put in a place-holding comma where the file_number would ordinarily go. In the example\nbelow, the programmer has not specified a file_number and has used the default delimiter value:\nx=glfd(5,,,field_holder)\nPlease note that if the #PRO3 compiler directive is set, then the program will use the non-TAS file\npointed to by the special file number as the buffer.",
