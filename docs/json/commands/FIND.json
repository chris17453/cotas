  "description": "Use this command to find a record in any TAS file opened with the OPEN command.\nfind_type - mgflnpr - Required - This is the type of FIND you want to execute. The options\nare:\nM - matching - Find the exact record based on the search_value option. You can also\nset the appropriate key fields with the EQUAL command and then the\nsearch_value option need not be used.\nG - generic - Same as match however the program will return the exact or next\ngreatest record.\nF - first - Find the first record in the file.\nL - last - Find the last record in the file.\nN - next - Find the next record. This assumes that you have done a search previously\nthat successfully found a record in the file (exact, generic, first, etc.).\nP - previous - Find the previous record. This assumes that you have done a search\npreviously that successfully found a record in the file (exact, generic, last,\netc.).\nR - related - In this type of search, the program will use the value in the related_field\nwhen searching for the record. NOTE: There is a process in TAS Pro 5.1\nwhere you can set relations between files outside of the FIND command. It\nis recommended that you use that method. Then TAS Pro 5.1 will automatically search for related records whenever a record is found\nusing any method.\nkey_or_file_name - sac - Required - If this is a type N or P (next or previous) search, then this\nvalue is the name of the file being searched in special alpha constant form (i.e., the\ntrue name of the file without quotes). Otherwise this is the name of the key being used\nfor the search, also in special alpha constant form.\nrelated_field - fn/v - The name of the field to use as the search value for this command.\nNOTE: There is a process in TAS Pro 5.1 where you can set relations between files\noutside of the FIND command. It is recommended that you use that method. Then\nTAS Pro 5.1 will automatically search for related records whenever a record is found\nusing any method.\nerror_label - label - Optional - If you specify a label here, the program will transfer control to\nthe appropriate line if an error occurs during the command.",
