An\nF type pointer keeps track of the field type and address in the field list buffer. Only 5 bytes are required\nfor this type of field. The P type pointer uses the actual location in memory and keeps track of the type,\nsize, decimal characters, etc. of the field being pointed to. The P type is necessary when pointing to an\narray field since the array value is not kept in an F type pointer. For more information about the layout,",
