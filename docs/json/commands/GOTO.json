  "comments": "This command, as opposed to the GOSUB, has no automatic way to return. You must use another\nGOTO to return to the next command, if desired. Generally, this command is used only in situations\nwhere you do not want to execute the lines following this command.\nThis command is not part of the regular ‘structured’ commands that a programmer would use in creating\na program. Much effort has been made in TAS Professional 5.1 so that this command need not be used\nat all. However, it remains here for those times you find it the expedient choice.",
