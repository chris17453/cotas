You can then look at field\nvalues, set other break points, etc. PRG - Set the next break point for a specific\nlocation in the program. This is better done using the option in the actual trace routine\nonce it has been executed since you need the actual location in the program of the line\nyou want to break on. FIELD - By naming a field the program will break at the line\nthe field is accessed, either read or updated. OFF - Turn off the trace routine. You\ncan also use this at the beginning to just set up the routine. Then during program\noperation you can press the ^B (ctrl+B) key and execute the trace routine at any point\nin the program."

The standard program provided with this version of TAS Professional 5.1 is\nBREAK.SRC. You include it in any program by putting the following line in the main program:\n#inc break\nIf you plan to distribute your program, make sure you remove this line, and not just because it takes up\nextra room. You may not include this routine in any program not being run at the same site that\nholds the license for the compiler.\nWhen this command is executed the program will display the trace window at the top of the screen and,\nif you have compiled the program with the -D (debug) flag, it will also display the actual source code\nline at the bottom. You can enter any expression and the program will display the result immediately\nbelow the entry line. Press the F2 key and a list of fields, along with their current values, will be\ndisplayed. Press the ^R key and the full screen will be displayed without any trace info; press any key to\nreturn to the trace box.",
