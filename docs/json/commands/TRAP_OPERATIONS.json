IGNR - reset to ignore.\nNOTE: If you choose IGNR the program will set all traps to DFLT (which for most is the equivalent of IGNR), and then the following are actually set to IGNR: F1 - F10 and ESC. This allows other keys that would be used in the normal course of operations to remain available, such as Up Arrow, Dn Arrow, Pg Up, Pg Dn, Pg_Brk, etc.\nIf you wish to set those to IGNR also you must do so with the TRAP command."
