      "description": "This option also restricts the records exported. However, the first time the expression resolves to .F., the program stops reading records and continues to the next command. Therefore, if the program is reading records in a certain order (by a specific key) and the expression returns .F., then the program knows that all the appropriate records have been read and there is no need to continue reading. For example: You want to export all the invoice records for a specific customer. The first record for that customer is found in the invoice file either by using the start_value option within this command, or through the FIND command before executing this command. Then the while_filter_expression would be: INV_CUST_CODE = CUSTOMER_CODE (This assumes that there is a field called INV_CUST_CODE in the invoice file and a similar field in the customer file called CUSTOMER_CODE. The keyname/ @key_number option must be set to the proper value so that the records are read in CUSTOMER_CODE order, or you must have executed the SRCH command previous to this command.) When the first invoice record for the next customer is read the program will stop reading records. NOTE: If there is no start_value you must set the scope value to R or N xxx. If this is not done, the program will find the first record in the file and the while_filter_expression option will probably fail the first time. However, if the start_value option is used you can ignore this requirement."

The last record read before exiting the command is still in the record buffer after the program leaves this command.",
