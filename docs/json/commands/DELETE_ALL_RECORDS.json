If the index you’re searching on has multiple segments you may list the proper value for each segment, separating them with commas. This will allow you to specify the exact type for each of the segments. For example, suppose you’re searching on an index that has two segments: a 5 character alpha and an I type field. Each record you want has the same alpha but the I field will change, and is in order. In the first record the I type field has a value of 0. The following would find the first record for that group, if it exists: start 'ABCDE',0! Notice that we separate the values with a comma. The only requirement is that the values be of the same type (and size) as the segments in the key. In this case we put the I type constant specifier (!) after the 0 to make sure that it is passed as an I type field."
