  "description": "Use this command to change a field previously defined within a program. This command will work only with DEFINE’d fields. The command will allow you to change any part of the field: size, type, etc., even the number of array elements. It is generally used in situations where you don’t know how large a field you might need and don’t want to take up space before it is needed. Also, you can DEALLOC (Array Deallocate) an allocated field during runtime. This capability is useful when you know you need to chain to other programs and might not have enough room if the field is at a set size.",
