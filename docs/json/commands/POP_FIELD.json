  "comments": "When you use the PUSHF command the field values are saved on an internal stack. This stack, just like all others used in microcomputers, is a Last In-First Out process. That means that the last value pushed on the stack must be the first value popped out. The TAS Professional 5.1 stack, however, is different from a ‘normal’ stack in that it is intelligent. It knows the sizes of the values being pushed/popped and automatically allows for the differences.",
