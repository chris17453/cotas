  "comments": "The ASK message will be displayed at the same location as the error message. The message will be word wrapped properly and the program will back up the cursor one character. To use this feature you should make sure that the last character in the message is a ‘Y’ or ‘N’ as appropriate. You can test the user’s response to the message through the ASK() function. If the ASK() function returns .T. the user answered Y to the question; if .F., N. If the user presses the ESC key at the question, the ASK() function returns .F. Also, you can test if the user pressed the ESC key through the use of the ESC() function. It will return .T. if the user pressed the ESC key.",
