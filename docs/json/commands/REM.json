The semicolon (;) or asterisk (*) may be\nused instead of REM so long as it is the first non-space character on the line. For remarks following a\ncommand on the same line, the programmer may use the double ampersand (&&). Some examples:\nREM All of the following remarks are legal\n; This is a legal remark\n* This is also.\n? ‘TEST’\n&& This is a legal remark after a command.\nThe programmer cannot put a remark on a command line if the command is continued. For example:\n? ‘THIS IS A TEST’+ \\ && this is not a legal remark\n‘ ALSO’\n&& this is a legal remark\nA remark cannot be put on the continued line since the continuation character (\\) must be the last\ncharacter on the line. Please note that a continuation character is treated as such, even if it appears on a\nline after a remark character.",
